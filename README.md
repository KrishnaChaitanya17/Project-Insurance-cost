These  considerations contribute  to the insurance policy  formulation.  Machine  learning  (ML)  for  the  insurance industry sector can make the wording of insurance policies more efficient.  This  study  demonstrates  how  different  models  of regression can forecast insurance costs. And we will compare the results  of  models,  for  example,  Multiple  Linear  Regression, Random Forest  Regressor.  This paper offers the best approach to the Random Forest  Regressormodel with an MAE value of 3930.33, RMSE value of 5643.21and R -squared value of 0.8.
